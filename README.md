# Cinema Room REST Service

My implementation of [Hyperskill][1] [Cinema Room Manager][2] project.
In this project, I created a simple Spring REST service that help manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

- [x] Stage 1/4: The show begins: Create a simple endpoint that returns the information about the available seats. 
- [x] Stage 2/4: Take your seat: Allow customers to purchase tickets.
- [x] Stage 3/4: A change of plans: Allow customers to refund their tickets. Generate unique tokens to identify the ticket.
- [x] Stage 4/4: The statistics: Add the movie theater statistics and secure the endpoint with a password.
